# TensorFlow

Using the Google Tenserflow Library, Python, and C++ the goal is to build and train an AI model.

Files:

tf_train_model_ASSIGNMENT_FILE.py -> contains the model, loss and accuracy functions, training functions and loops, and plots model
                                     accuracy to measure anticipated performance.
tf_evaluate_model_code.py         -> evaluates/tests model with new handwritten digit images to see true testing accuracy

Methodology:

Multi-Layer Neural Network using Convolutional layers wit Max Pooling, Dropout to training, Weight + Bias Parameter initialization, 
and Longer Training + Increased Batch Size.
